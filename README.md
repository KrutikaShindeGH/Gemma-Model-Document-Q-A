# Overview

Welcome to the Gemma Model Document Q&A project! This project aims to create an interactive question-and-answer system using the Gemma large language model (LLM) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. The system is designed to handle complex queries related to documents, providing accurate and relevant answers by retrieving information from a corpus and generating responses based on the retrieved data.

# Features

1. Interactive Q&A system
2. Integration of Gemma LLM
3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate answers
4. Easy-to-use Streamlit web application interface

# Technologies Used

1. Python: Core programming language
2. Streamlit: For creating the web application interface
3. Gemma LLM: The language model used for generating responses
4. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Technique used to enhance the accuracy of responses by retrieving relevant information 
5. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): For efficient similarity search and information retrieval
6. Google Embedding Model: We use Google's embedding model to transform text into high-dimensional vectors, enabling more effective retrieval and matching of relevant information from the document.
